# GLUT - Community-driven Food Delivery System
#### OVERVIEW
It is about time we say our farewells to expensive food delivery charges. Gone will be the days when students feel the ache having to pay significant amounts for supper delivery when working hard through the night. For the general population, the time has come for effective and cheap food delivery. The aim of our team is to make communityÂ­driven food delivery so viable such that it is not justifiable for any F&B company to have their own delivery unit anymore. Tasting food from otherwise inaccessible areas to you and making new friends at your home, work, and school community will never be easier.

#### INSPIRATION
Many of us, be it students who are busy with assignments or the elderly who are immobile, find it inconvenient to travel out the comfort of our home just for a meal and hope that there would be cheap delivered food which is not conventional fast food.

#### WHAT IT DOES
Glut provides a platform for users who are too busy and require delivering services for food to have the convenience of that service for any type of food that they crave for for an incredibly cheap delivery fee, while civilian deliverers can enjoy the spirit of helping their neighbours, colleagues or schoolmates get meals while earning some extra income for their offered services.
